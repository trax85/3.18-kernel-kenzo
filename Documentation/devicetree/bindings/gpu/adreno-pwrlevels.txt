Qualcomm GPU powerlevels

Powerlevels are defined in sets by qcom,gpu-pwrlevels. Multiple sets (bins)
can be defined within qcom,gpu-pwrelvel-bins. Each powerlevel defines a
voltage, bus, and bandwitdh level.

- qcom,gpu-pwrlevel-bins:	Contains one or more qcom,gpu-pwrlevels sets

Properties:
- compatible:			Must be qcom,gpu-pwrlevel-bins
- qcom,gpu-pwrlevels:		Defines a set of powerlevels

Properties:
- qcom,speed-bin:		Speed bin identifier for the set - must match
				the value read from the hardware
- qcom,initial-pwrlevel:	GPU wakeup powerlevel

- qcom,gpu-pwrlevel:		A single powerlevel

Properties:
- reg:				Index of the powerlevel (0 = highest perf)
- qcom,gpu-freq			GPU frequency for the powerlevel (in Hz)
- qcom,bus-freq			Index to a bus level (defined by the bus
				settings)
- qcom,bus-min			Minimum bus level to set for the power level
- qcom,bus-max			maximum bus level to set for the power level
=======
Adreno Power Levels

The Adreno GPU definition should include a variable number of power levels
defining the GPU and bus frequencies for the levels that the GPU can operate at.

Required properties:

- compatible:	The compatible name for the object (qcom,gpu-pwrlevels)

Each powerlevel definition is as follows:

- reg:              Index of the power level (lower is considered higher
		    performance)
- qcom,gpu-freq:    The GPU frequency for the power level (in HZ)
- qcom,bus-freq:    An index representing the default bus scaling appropriate
		    for the power level
- qcom,bus-min:     An optional index representing the minimum bus scaling
		    appropriate for the power level
- qcom,bus-max:     An optional index representing the maximum bus scaling
		    appropriate for the power level

Sample usage:

qcom,kgsl-3d0@fdb00000 {
	...
	qcom,gpu-pwrlevels {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		compatible = "qcom,gpu-pwrlevels";

		qcom,gpu-pwrlevel@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			qcom,gpu-freq = <5000000000>;
			qcom,bus-freq = <3>;
			qcom,bus-min = <2>;
			qcom,bus-max = <4>;
		};
	};

	...
};
